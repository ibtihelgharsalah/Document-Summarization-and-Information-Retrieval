# Document-Summarization-and-Information-Retrieval
## My end-of-studies project
An NLP-powered, web aplication that :  
1- Takes a bunch of IT-related text documents as input  
2- Classifies them by language and by topic  
3- Retrieves the necessary information to answer a number of pre-defined questions accordingly  


This application is mainly targeted to KPMG IT-auditors who used to struggle while manually performing the "IT understanding" phase.
