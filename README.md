# Document-Summarization-and-Information-Retrieval
## My end-of-studies project
An NLP-powered, web aplication that takes a bunch of IT-related text documents as input, fetches them, 
and retrieves the necessary information to answer a number of pre-defined questions accordingly.

This application is mainly targeted to IT-auditors who used to suffer while performing the "IT understanding" phase manually.
